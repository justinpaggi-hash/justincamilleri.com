Sport, in this context, is not a personal pursuit. It functions as a controlled environment in which decision making, preparation, and execution can be tested under constraint.

I lost my left hand in an accident at work when I was eighteen years old. The constraint that followed was permanent. What evolved over time was not the condition itself, but how I learned to operate within it.

I began structured training in indoor rowing later in life. The initial motivation was health and fitness rather than competition. Training introduced discipline, structure, and objective feedback. Competition was not the original goal.

That changed after the first competitive event. Preparing for it required a more deliberate approach to training and execution. The results were stronger than expected and, more importantly, repeatable. That combination indicated that performance could be pursued seriously rather than incidentally.

I compete in indoor rowing in the PR3 single arm (SA) category. From the outset, I did not approach sport from a position of disadvantage. The objective was not accommodation, but performance measured against objective standards.

## Competitive results

Results matter here only insofar as they demonstrate that the underlying approach scales across distance, intensity, and competitive context.

I hold Concept2 World Records in the Men 30–39 PR3 (Single Arm) category across the 500m, 1000m, 2000m, 1 minute, and 4 minutes events.

At the British Indoor Rowing Championships, I established championship records in the IAR3 Open category in the 1 minute, 4 minutes, and 2000m races.

At the Malta National Indoor Rowing Championships, I placed first in all adaptive PR3 races over 2000m, 1000m, and 500m, and placed third overall in the 30–39 men’s 1000m race, competing alongside able bodied athletes.

Competing against able bodied categories is a deliberate choice. It reflects how I approach constraint more generally: not as a defining limitation, but as a design parameter. Performance is assessed against fixed benchmarks, not adjusted expectations.

## Design and adaptation

The adaptations required to row effectively in this category were not available off the shelf. Equipment and technique had to be designed from first principles. The solutions currently in use were developed independently through observation, experimentation, and iteration.

I have not encountered comparable adaptations in the competitions I have attended. Athletes and officials from other sports disciplines have approached me to understand the design logic behind these solutions. That interest is incidental. What matters is that the adaptations work, are repeatable, and perform reliably under competitive conditions.

This process reflects how I approach challenges more broadly. Constraints are analysed, assumptions are tested, solutions are designed, and execution is refined through feedback. Progress is not driven by resilience as an abstract idea, but by preparation and deliberate system design.

The value of sport, for me, is not achievement. It is clarity. Under constraint, weak assumptions fail quickly. Well designed systems compound. That principle applies far beyond competition.
