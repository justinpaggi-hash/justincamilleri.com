Introducing my online journal.

Welcome to my online journal. I am Justin John Camilleri, and I will be using this space as a tool to relieve my mind from thoughts while sharing some observations I will be making along the way, both professionally and in everyday life.

To be honest, I was always skeptical of keeping a journal or a diary to write one’s thoughts, I used to think that the practice was a waste of time. On the other hand, I swear about the importance of having to do lists, as these help an individual to be much more efficient both in life and career. However, the most important aspect of to do lists is that there won’t be the need to use my mind to keep remembering that a task needs to be executed, but the list will do that for me. Relieving noise from my mind and allowing me to free my mind, so that my mind will operate more efficiently.

Sometimes there are thoughts and observations that are repeated and, in my mind, I argue the same things. I believe that this is waste of mind energy which in the end adds useless stress.

I am now embarking on this experiment to starting documenting my thoughts and observations, which some of them might be so brilliant that it would be a pity not to share them with any one, at the same time I am sure that there will be thoughts that for you as the reader, it will be a huge waste of time, however, the good thing would be that I freed my mind from the thought.

My objective is simple. By putting thoughts into words, I believe that I will be better able to focus on what matters next, think more clearly about future objectives, and reflect on decisions with some distance. 

The plan is to touch on a variety of subjects, some will relate to professional life, leadership, and organisation. Others may be drawn from day-to-day experiences. What this journal will not be is my personal diary, I will not be vulnerable, sharing my feelings or write about my day.

For clarity, everything shared here represents my personal views only. Nothing on this blog should be taken as professional, medical, financial, or legal advice. Where such matters are concerned, qualified professionals should always be consulted.
This blog is therefore best read as an ongoing thought process rather than a set of conclusions. It is a space for structured thinking, not certainty. I invite you to follow this journal and be part of this journey. Enjoy the ride.
