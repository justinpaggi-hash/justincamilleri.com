Welcome to my online journal. I am Justin John Camilleri, and I will be using this space as a tool to relieve my mind from persistent thoughts, while sharing observations I make along the way, both professionally and in everyday life.

For a long time, I was skeptical about keeping a journal or a diary. I considered the practice a poor use of time. In contrast, I have always believed strongly in the value of to do lists. They help structure both professional and personal life, but more importantly, they remove the burden of remembering tasks. The list carries that responsibility, not the mind. This reduces mental noise and allows clearer thinking.

Over time, I noticed a similar pattern with thoughts and observations. Certain ideas repeat themselves. The same internal arguments resurface, often without adding anything new. I have come to see this as wasted mental energy, which eventually turns into unnecessary stress.

This journal is an experiment. I am documenting thoughts and observations to remove them from my mind and place them somewhere structured. Some may be useful to others. Some may not. That is acceptable. The primary objective is to free mental space. Any value for the reader is a secondary outcome.

The objective is simple. By putting thoughts into words, I aim to focus more clearly on what matters next, think with greater distance about future objectives, and reflect on decisions with less internal noise.

The topics will vary. Some entries will relate to professional life, leadership, and organisation. Others will emerge from day to day experiences. What this journal will not be is a personal diary. I will not be documenting emotions, personal struggles, or daily routines. This is not a space for vulnerability, but for structured thinking.

For clarity, everything shared here represents my personal views only. Nothing on this blog should be interpreted as professional, medical, financial, or legal advice. Where such matters are concerned, qualified professionals should always be consulted.

This journal is best read as an ongoing thought process rather than a set of conclusions. It is a space for clarity, not certainty.
