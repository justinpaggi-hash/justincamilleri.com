Informal listening inside organisations is often viewed as a positive signal. When employees feel comfortable sharing concerns with trusted colleagues, this is commonly associated with openness and trust. At the same time, informal listening can reveal something more complex. It shows how concerns move through the organisation, where they pause, and whether they ever reach a point where decisions can be taken.

In many situations, issues do not remain unresolved because they are ignored. They remain unresolved because they never surface in the right forum. Rather than moving through structured channels, concerns are shared privately with individuals perceived as safe, available, or discreet. These informal confidants gradually become holding spaces for unresolved matters. From an organisational perspective, this can reduce clarity rather than enhance transparency.

This has consequences for how decisions are shaped. Leadership teams rely on the information that reaches them. When relevant signals remain informal, performance can appear stable while pressure accumulates elsewhere. Over time, the gap between what is visible and what is experienced may widen.

Informal confidants tend to emerge where accessibility is high and boundaries are loose. In some cases, this reflects gaps in leadership or support structures. In others, it is simply a matter of proximity. Individuals who are consistently available and willing to listen often become the easiest outlet. Sharing brings immediate relief, creating the impression that something has improved. In practice, little changes. The issue has not been escalated or assigned ownership. It has merely moved.

In certain situations, this dynamic becomes more problematic. The confidant is not only a passive listener but an enabler. By encouraging colleagues to confide, reinforcing private disclosure, or positioning themselves as the safest route, the individual can consolidate informal influence. This may be unintentional, but it can also be deliberate. Over time, it distorts team dynamics, elevating perceived authority without formal responsibility and creating dependency rather than resolution.

As informal conversations replace formal processes, escalation is delayed. Not necessarily out of fear, but because discretion is implicitly rewarded. Teams learn that expression is safer than challenge. Grumbling becomes habitual, not as resistance, but as a coping mechanism. Criticism circulates without consequence, and responsibility remains diffuse.

From an organisational standpoint, this weakens accountability and distorts feedback loops. Leadership sees outcomes, but not always the conditions producing them.

Informal confidants, in this sense, are not solutions. They are indicators.

They reveal how information flows, where it stops, and what the organisation has normalised.

The issue is not informal conversation itself. It is when listening becomes containment, and empathy replaces accountability. When boundaries are clearer, informal dialogue retains its human value while formal processes regain relevance.

Organisations rarely struggle because people talk. Difficulties arise when talking becomes a substitute for responsibility.
