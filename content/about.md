Justin John Camilleri
Strategy, leadership, and decision making. Para athlete.

I work at the intersection of strategy, structure, and decision making, with a clear focus on how organisations grow, perform, and endure. My work is shaped by disciplined thinking, reflection, and direct engagement with complexity.

Alongside my professional work, I compete as a para athlete in indoor rowing at international level. Sport has shaped how I approach challenge, preparation, and feedback, principles that carry directly into my work with leaders and organisations. I focus on clarity, consistency, and progress, in both professional life and beyond.
